<h3> Tower defense built with Unity </h3>

<i>Players must survive 10 waves of enemies (indicated by the plane icon) to complete a level. The final wave is a challenge with a single, powerful boss enemy: a tank. </i>

Enemy paths are calculated using a custom implementation of the <b>A* algorithm</b>. Before a turret is placed, the game verifies that there is still at least one valid path from the spawn point (on the left) to the base (on the right). This ensures that enemies cannot be entirely blocked or surrounded by turrets.

We have implemented three maps, each with different strategies required to win.
